              <p>
                Homeopathy is a natural form of medicine used by over 200
                million people worldwide to treat both acute and chronic
                conditions. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like' â€“
                in other words, a substance that would cause symptoms in a
                healthy person is used to treat those same symptoms in illness.

                Homeopathic medicines should typically be taken on a clean
                mouth, away from food, drinks, or strong flavors like mint
                (toothpaste), coffee, or spices. The dosage instructions are
                provided on the product packaging or as prescribed by your
                homeopathic practitioner. For detailed usage instructions for
                specific products, please refer to the product descriptions on
                our website or consult with a qualified homeopathic
                practitioner.

                Homeopathic medicines are generally considered safe with minimal
                to no side effects when taken as directed. They are made from
                highly diluted natural substances. However, individual
                sensitivity may vary, and some people might experience a
                temporary worsening of symptoms (known as a homeopathic
                aggravation) before improvement. If you experience any
                concerning symptoms, please consult a healthcare professional.

      "The customer service provided by this local Homeopathic shop in mangalore is absolutely outstanding! My experience can't be expressed in words as to how glad I ordered from this shop. Just to give you an example, I required one homeopathic medicine urgently and I called them and they arranged immediately and shipped it out by end of the day! That's pure service excellence in customer service ! Thanks again ! I have bought homeopathic twice and was totally satisfied with the service! You deserve the 5 star rating ! üëçüëè One thing I can promise is you will never get this level of personalised service online with Amazon or other e-commerce platforms !",
